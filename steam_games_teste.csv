Meek and mild, she prefers to keep her head down, and fears drawing undue attention to herself. As a governess to the wealthy Mortimer family, Letitia devotes her humdrum days in London to the schooling of her pupil, Clara, to better mould her into the image of an ideal lady. Lurking beneath Letitia’s placid mannerisms, however, lay desires so intense they begin to unnerve her. As Clara matures, Letitia finds her feelings towards her maturing too – until, in the end, she can no longer bear it. Driven to distraction by Clara’s sensuous brown eyes and her sweet, seraphic laughter, Letitia soon begins to question her sanity. Fearful that, eventually, something within her might snap, and she will do something she regrets, Letitia is bidden to leave her former place of employment, and to seek out work elsewhere. Fortunately, Letitia soon discovers, in the pages of The Morning Post, a job offer which will grant her a means to escape her predicament. The Langley family are searching for a governess for their daughter, the unruly Genevieve – and, best of all, the family resides in the isolated Yorkshire moors, which seems as far away from London as it is possible to get. Upon reading this advertisement, Letitia soon decides to hand in her notice. She will travel to Yorkshire, become Genevieve’s governess, and then – God willing – she will be able to forget about Clara. Such was Letitia’s plan – but this plan, alas, soon goes horribly awry. Genevieve is not quite so young as Letitia first believed, and is, instead, a grown woman: already eighteen years of age. Genevieve is wilful and impetuous, but impossibly charming, and Letitia soon falls for her. As time passes, the two women get far closer than a governess and her pupil ought, and then… A story written by ebi-hime, the author of Blackberry Honey About 120k words of text (approx 4-8 hours of reading) A kinetic story with no choices/branches Detailed character and background artwork A custom OST A dramatic gothic romance story Suffering","['English', 'Simplified Chinese']","[]","","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1779960/header.jpg?t=1650996062","","","ebihimes@gmail.com",True,False,True,0,"",0,35,5,"",12,0,"The story includes some crude language, and heavy implications that the two main female characters are involved in a sexual relationship, though this is not explicitly depicted in the story.

The object is to capture the cities of the world with your military units. The game is over when one player has more than twice as many cities than his opponent. Each city can create one unit per game turn, so the more cities you conquer the more units you can muster and the greater your chances of victory. In some ways the game is like chess, in that it is a game of positioning and maneuver; there is no random chance involved in determining whether a unit defeats an enemy unit. However, you must also use the terrain to gain advantage, and must sometimes contend with imperfect knowledge, such as managing the danger of deadly, invisible submarines. There are 10 types of military unit that have unique roles that must be combined to deceive, outrun, outwit and overwhelm your opponent. Features: Multiplayer mode over LAN, Wi-Fi or internet.

1938530,"Knightblade","Apr 4, 2022","0 - 20000",0,0,4.99,0,"A retro open world RPG, farming sim, and dungeon crawler. Knightblade is best described as an open world fantasy game mixed with farming and life sim elements, as if it were made in the golden age of video games. After creating your character from the 8 options presented to you (four classes, two genders, eight sprite options), our future hero will move into a beautiful little town and start their life as a humble farmer. But quickly you realize there is a mystery focused on the dungeons that lurk below. A mystery that involves the God of Death, and your own family legacy. Explore the world through a retro-style world map, explore the towns and locales of the region. Farm and mine to earn precious gold. Help local citizens with quests. Fall in love. Then head into the deep dark dungeons.. clear each one, slaughtering monsters and collecting treasure, while slowly the mystery of why you came to this town will begin to unravel. This is Knightblade. This is a low-cost game designed with a main story that can be completed in a couple hours. Players can rush through it, but they won't find all there is to discover. It's encouraged to play at your own pace and explore the world. The farming elements are not complex, there is a larger focus on clearing dungeons. Each dungeon cleared advances the story forward. But the main goal is freedom for the player. Players can grind in the dungeons, or focus on other things. Explore a retro themed open world. Battle monsters in animated turn-based combat. Live a virtual life. Get married! Farm! Mine! Go fishing! Play a few casino games! Complete the main quest and unlock new things to do. ~2 hours of storyline, with unlimited gameplay after the story as the game doesn't end. Change graphic styles, filters, or even go retro black and white! Multiple controller options. Supports mouse, keyboard, controllers, and even touch! Cloud save support. Play across different devices! Steam Deck Compatible. Works out of the box with all control options available. Discover little secrets like cheat codes hidden in the game. Take on bounty hunter quests. New updates with more content will be on the way.
